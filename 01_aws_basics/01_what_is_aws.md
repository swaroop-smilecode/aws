#### What is AWS?
Think like this.</br>
What is a `Service`?</br>
You will give money to others & other will provide service for you(service means, work done by others for you in return of money).</br>
In the same way, `Web Services` is the service provided through internet(web). That's why the name `web services`.</br> 
Since the owner of this web services is amazon, it became `Amazon web services(aws)`.

#### Ok, well & good. How do you access those services?
Of course through REST API's.</br>
Those services will expose API's & as a customer, you comsume them.
