#### What is VPC?
- VPC stands for `Virtual Private Cloud`.
- It's your own network in an geographic region. In an geographic region, many people will setup their infrastructure.</br>
  how will you separate your infrastrcuture from others? Through VPC. It's like a boundary wall around your infrastructure.</br>
- Atleast one VPC is needed, because that's how your infrastructure can be isolated from other others.
