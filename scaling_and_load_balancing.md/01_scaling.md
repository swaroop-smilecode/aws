#### What is scaling?
Increasing/decreasing the number of servers, in proportion to load.

#### Name of the AWS service for implementing Scaling feature.
`Auto scaling group`

#### Can you do scaling on on-premise?
Ofcourse, but you need to maintain some extra servers which are ideal when there is no huge load</br> 
But, the capital invested on those ideal servers is not giving any return during this ideal period.</br>
