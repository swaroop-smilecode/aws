By default, lambda functions are run inside an VPC, which is created & maintained by lambda.</br>
Be aware that this VPC is different from the default VPC, that's created for your account.</br>
Because of this reason, lambda will have access to only internet & AWS services.</br>
So, how will you connect to the AWS services inside an private subnet?</br>
