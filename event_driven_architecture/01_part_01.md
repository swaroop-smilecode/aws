### Building Cattube
Let's see different types of architectures through an example.
How about building `Cattube`?

### Monolothic architecture
One way is building through `Monolithic Architecture`. The problems associated with this architecture are:
1. Fails together
2. Scales together -- As entire hardware is built as single unit, you can scale it vertically, not horizantally.
3. Bills together

### Tier architecture
Components are separated, so that any one of the component can be scaled vertically independent of another.</br>

But, components can't be scaled horizantally, because of the reason, who will communicate between multilpe components?</br>
To make them scale Horizantally, let's improve the architecture as below.</br>

But, it still has below problem:
Atleast one instance of `Processing tier` needs to exist, </br>
because when there is a request comes from `Upload tier` to `processing tier`, what if the `processing tier` is in failed condition?</br> 
there is no middle man to hold the request, until the `Upload tier` comes back to work again.</br>
This is called `Synchronous communication`, becasue `Processing tier` can't proceed further, unless it gets answer from `Upload tier`.
