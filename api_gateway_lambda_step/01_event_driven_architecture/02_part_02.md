Let's keep evolving our architecture, this time with the help of `queue`.</br>
Using queue, results in decoupled architecture.</br>
In this case, upload tier uploads the video into `s3` bucket & append's an message to the queue.</br>
Note that this message will have information about how to fing the respective video present inside the s3 bucket.</br> 
With this, we evolved from synchronous communication to asynchronous communication.</br>

On the other side of the queue, `Auto Scaling Group` is present which creates & destroys the processing servers</br>
based on number of items present inside the queue.</br>
The processing servers will `poll` the queue for messages & starts processing them.

### Micro service architecture
If you keep making all the components inside an system to communicate in asynchronous manner,</br>
will end up with Micro service architecture.</br>
In Micro services architecture terminology, those services which produce the messages are called `Producers`</br>
those which consumes the messages are called `Consumers`.

If we go a step further & imrprove our architecture a bit more elegantly, then each micro service herself is an</br>
self sufficient component with it's own logic works independently of any other component, it's own database.</br>

When application grows & grows, the number of queues get increased which results in cumbersome architecture &</br>
inorder to clean it up, will use `Event router`.
